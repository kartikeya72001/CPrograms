/*The difference between getc() and getchar() is getc()
can read from any input stream, but getchar() reads
from standard input. So getchar() is equivalent to getc(stdin).*/


// Example for getch() in C
   printf("%c", getch());
/*it reads also a single character from keyboard. But it does
not use any buffer, so the entered character is immediately
returned without waiting for the enter key.*/


// Example for getche() in C
  printf("%c", getche());

}

/*Like getch(), this is also a non-standard function present
in conio.h. It reads a single character from the keyboard
and displays twice immediately on output screen without waiting for
enter key.*/
